# cohortData

This project is being used to calculate the % of students flexing back.

Question:

How many students from my initial cohort are here?

Steps to Take:

1) Determine best projects to use as examples
    a) Sprints since most students cannot complete these beforehand, but include the date when I completed and 4 days before incase of git cloning the night before.

Sprints by Date:

8/23 - Sprint-Challenge-Single-Page-Apps
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-Single-Page-Apps

8/16 - Sprint-Challenge-React-Wars
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-React-Wars

8/9 - Sprint-Challenge-Applied-Javascript
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-Applied-Javascript

7/26 - Sprint-Challenge--JavaScript
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--JavaScript

7/19 - Sprint-Challenge--Advanced-CSS
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--Advanced-CSS

7/12 - Sprint-Challenge--User-Interface
Forked from LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge--User-Interface

2) Determine the users that are assumably in my cohort via the Sprint on 7/12 - will need these users hardcoded
    a) axios request from github

3) Determine how many of those students are on next sprint, etc (how many students are no longer there)

4) Assuming this, we will be able to determine how many students have dropped out before each sprint every week
